                <p>
                  Sri Lanka is also known as ‘pearl of the Indian Ocean’, this is said to be named after 
                  its incredible beauty, varied biodiversity (the highest in Asia!), 
                  as well as one of its main exports being precious gemstones. But Sri Lanka is
                  formerly known as Ceylon, and officially the Democratic Socialist Republic 
                  of Sri Lanka, is an island country in South Asia. It lies in the Indian Ocean.
                  Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is its legislative capital, and Colombo is its largest 
                  city and financial centre.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sri Lanka's documented history goes back 3,000 years, with evidence of prehistoric human 
                  settlements that dates to at least 125,000 years ago. It has a rich cultural heritage.
                  After years of being seemingly overlooked by travellers heading elsewhere, Sri Lanka is 
                  now becoming a popular destination of choice and it’s not hard to see why. Sri Lanka is a 
                  small but diverse country with plenty of charm; from pristine beaches and incredible wildlife 
                  to famous tea and ancient ruins, there is something for everyone on this island. Even better, 
                  distances are short, which make it easier to discover lots in a shorter space of time than, for 
                  instance, its neighbour India.

                                      Sri Lanka established provincial councils. Between 1988 and 2006 the province was temporarily merged

These are considered to be some of the best examples of ancient Sinhalese sculpting and carving arts, and have made the Gal Vihara the most visited monument at Polonnaruwa.</p>

                                          Yapahuwa was one of the ephemeral capitals of medieval Sri Lanka. The citadel of Yapahuwa lying midway between Kurunagala and Anuradhapura was built around a huge granite rock rising abruptly almost a hundred meters above the surrounding lowlands. In 1272, King Bhuvenakabahu transferred the capital from Polonnaruwa to Yapahuwa in the face of Dravidian invasions from South India, bringing the Sacred Tooth Relic with him. Following the death of King Bhuvenakabahu in 1284, the Pandyans of South India invaded Sri Lanka once again, and succeeded in capturing Sacred Tooth Relic. Following its capture, Yapahuwa was largely abandoned and inhabited by Buddhist monks and religious ascetics.

                                  Sometimes called the temple of 1,000 pillars, the medieval Huindu temple of Koneswaram Temple, dedicated to Shiva, sits on a rocky cape. Although destroyed and rebuilt throughout its history, this 17th-century structure still stands as an example of classic Dravidian architecture. Numerous hymns and pieces of literature mention the temple for both its traditions and its large quantities of gold, pearls, jewels, and silk. Today, you can observe artifacts saved from the ruins that now feature in the current temple, which was rebuilt in 1963. Be sure to admire the sights, including a sweeping view of the sea. If you arrive early, you can catch a fantastic view of the sunrise.

                              Experience everyday local tradition and take a bath in the holy waters of Kanniya Hot Springs. The earliest references to this site date back to the Ravana period, over 5,000 years ago. Today, locals who wish to benefit from the water's medicinal properties visit the wells. Step onto the tile floor and find seven man-made square-shaped wells, each no more than waist-deep. Grab a bucket, scoop out some water (sourced from natural springs below), and take a bath the local way. Notice that each of the wells varies slightly in temperature.

It is located in the royal palace complex which houses the Relic of the tooth of Buddha. Since ancient times, the relic has played an important role in local politics because it is believed that whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country. Kandy was the last capital of the Sinhalese kings and is a UNESCO world heritage site partly due to the temple. The temple which houses the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha is one of the holiest shrines in the entire Buddhist world.

                              Pidurangala is a massive rock formation located a few kilometers north of Sigiriya in Sri Lanka. It has an interesting history closely related to that of the Sigiriya Rock Fortress. Climbing to the top of Pidurangala Rock is more strenuous than climbing Sigiriya. If you are fit and adventurous it is a climb worth making. It will take you about two hours. There is far less to see on this site than Sigiriya.

                                    The Nine Arch Bridge is a bridge in Sri Lanka. It is one of the best examples of colonial-era railway construction in the country. The construction of the bridge is generally attributed to a local Ceylonese builder, P. K. Appuhami, in consultation with British engineers. The chief designer and project manager of the 'upcountry railway line of Ceylon' project was D. J. Wimalasurendra, a distinguished Ceylonese engineer and inventor. The designer of the viaduct was Harold Cuthbert Marwood of Railway Construction Department of Ceylon Government Railway. The 1923 report titled Construction of a Concrete Railway Viaduct in Ceylon published by the Engineering Association of Ceylon has details of all the records including the plans and drawings. It is located in Demodara, between Ella and Demodara.

                                    Kataragamam temple in Kataragama, Sri Lanka, is a temple complex dedicated to Buddhist guardian deity Kataragama deviyo and Hindu War God Murugan. It is one of the few religious sites in Sri Lanka that is venerated by the Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and the Vedda people. For most of the past millennia, it was a jungle shrine very difficult to access; today it is accessible by an all-weather road. The shrines and the nearby Kiri Vehera are managed by Buddhists, the shrines dedicated to Teyvāṉai and Shiva are managed by Hindus and the mosque by Muslims. Up until the 1940s a majority of the pilgrims were Tamil Hindus from Sri Lanka and South India who undertook an arduous padayatra or pilgrimage on foot. Since then most pilgrims tend to be Sinhala Buddhists and the cult of God Kataragama.

It was first opened to the public on 9 May 1992 and is located in a 1671 Dutch Warehouse above the Old Gate of Galle Fort.

Under Sri Lanka – Netherlands Cultural Co-operation Program, the Royal Government of Netherlands provided financial assistance for reconstruction of the Maritime Museum. After 3 years period of reconstruction, the Maritime Museum was re-opened to the public.
